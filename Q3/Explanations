QUESTION 3:
-----------

================================================================================================================

Part (a):

ROLE:
-----

A Role is an entity that contains Database privileges. A role can be though of as either one or multiple database users.
For instance a role could be given to a user
with a password by CREATE USER usrname WITH PASSWORD passwrd;


ROLE_BASED ACCESS CONTROL:
--------------------------

Is a way of controlling which users of the database server, have which rights (i.e what they can/can't access and view etc.) It ensures that users of the database do not have access to things they should not be able to view. In a business context (as a rough example) this might mean restricting confidential data from someone who is a tester, and only allowing Developers or DBA's to view the data 

PUBLIC:
-------

PUBLIC refers to the implicitly defined group of ALL roles.

GRANT:
------

Grant is used to specify which privileges should be given to a Role. So you can grant a user all privileges 
on a database, and you would do so with something like: GRANT ALL ON dbname postgresvtdb TO nameofrole;
Or you can grant a user/role the privilege of granting/revoking database membership to others by using 
WITH ADMIN OPTION.

REVOKE:
-------

Revoke is a command used to revoke previously granted priviledges from one or several roles. For
REVOKE from PUBLIC means revoke previously granted priviledges from ALL roles, however if a user has a priviledge granted to them directly or via another role, that user will not lose the respective priviledge. 

================================================================================================================

Part (b):

* GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE <your_database_name> TO PUBLIC; 

PUBLIC refers to the group of ALL roles in the database, i.e all of the Database users.
This Query is therefore used to grant all database users the "priviledge" of connecting to/accessing your database.

*GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE ON MAJOR, STUDENT,
COURSE, RESULT, GRADUATE TO PUBLIC; 

This Query is used to grant all users(roles) of the database the priviledges to perform the opperations
SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, on the tables MAJOR, STUDENT, COURSE, RESULT, GRADUATE, in your Database.

================================================================================================================


Part (c):

* What happens if the RESULT table is missing in the SQL command in part b

Then all users/roles of the database would not be able to perform SELECT, INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE queries on the 
RESULT table. I.E they would be unable to view,add or modify data in the RESULT table.

Part (d):

* What happens if the UPDATE operation is missing in the SQL command in part b)? 

Then all users/roles would only be able to perform SELECT, INSERT and DELETE queries on the tables : MAJOR, STUDENT, COURSE, RESULT and  GRADUATE. I.E they would be unable to update any records in any of the specified tables.
